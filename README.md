# üçø My Package

An example of a Python package and app that was scaffolded with [Poetry Cookiecutter](https://github.com/radix-ai/poetry-cookiecutter).

## Using

To add and install this package as a dependency of your project, run `poetry add my-package`.

To view this app's commands once it's installed, run `my-package --help`. Alternatively, you can also use `docker compose run --rm app --help`.

To serve this app, run `docker compose up app` and open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Within the Dev Container, this is equivalent to running `poe serve`.
